    This application uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of a person having a stroke based on various health and lifestyle features.

    **How to use this app:**
    - Enter the relevant information in the input fields, such as age, BMI, gender, hypertension status, and more.
    - The app will predict the likelihood of stroke risk based on the provided data.
    - Once the prediction is made, the app will display the stroke risk percentage and its associated risk level.

    **Stroke Risk Levels:**
    - **High risk**: A stroke probability of 80% or more.
    - **Moderate risk**: A stroke probability between 50% and 80%.
    - **Low risk**: A stroke probability below 50%.

    **Important:** If the app shows a high risk of stroke, please seek immediate medical consultation.
